## FreeCodeCamp Data Analysis with Python Projects

This repository contains complete solutions for the five projects in the [freeCodeCamp Data Analysis with Python certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/) curriculum.  
Each project is implemented in Python and utilizes libraries such as **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and **SciPy**. All projects are designed to run seamlessly in **Google Colab** or any Python environment with the required libraries installed.

### ðŸ›  Projects Included

1. **Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator**  
   A calculator that computes the mean, variance, standard deviation, max, min, and sum of a 3x3 matrix.

2. **Demographic Data Analyzer**  
   Analyzes demographic data using Pandas to answer specific statistical questions.

3. **Medical Data Visualizer**  
   Visualizes a medical dataset using categorical plots and heatmaps to explore correlations and outliers.

4. **Page View Time Series Visualizer**  
   Uses time series data to create line plots, bar plots, and box plots to reveal trends and patterns in website traffic.

5. **Sea Level Predictor**  
   Applies linear regression using SciPy to predict future sea level rise based on historical data.
